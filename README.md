gzmq
====

[ØMQ](http://www.zeromq.org) abstractions for [Go](http://golang.org), based on [gozmq](https://github.com/alecthomas/gozmq).

See the [documentation](http://go.pkgdoc.org/github.com/jtacoma/gzmq).

This package provides one thing: a bridge between ØMQ sockets and Go channels.

It may provide other things in the future.
