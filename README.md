# zmqutil

Package zmqutil implements some ØMQ (http://www.zeromq.org) abstractions
and utilities.

A context from this package remembers its sockets and has its own Linger
option.  When a context is closed, it will set the Linger option on each
socket that would linger longer and then close them all.

An additonal type, Poller, provides a convenient way to attach event
handlers to sockets.

## Building

Build tags are used to distinguish versions of ØMQ.  Version 2.1 is `zmq_2_1`,
2.2 is `zmq_2_x`, and 3.2 is `zmq_3_x`.  If no build tags are specified then the
default is 2.2 and this is reflected in the documentation generated by godoc.

## Status

This package is in early development and is not widely used so the public API
