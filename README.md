# zmqutil

Package zmqutil implements some ØMQ (http://www.zeromq.org) abstractions and
utilities.

A context from this package remembers its sockets and has its own Linger
option.  When a context is closed, it will set the Linger option on each
socket then close them all.

All socket options are available through option-specific getter/setter methods.

A reactor loop that lets event handlers be attached to sockets.

	package main

	import (
		"errors"
		"time"

		"github.com/jtacoma/go-zmqutil"
	)

	func main() {
		context := zmqutil.NewContext()
		defer context.Close()
		context.SetLinger(1 * time.Second)
		socket := context.NewSocket(zmqutil.SUB)
		poller := zmqutil.NewPoller(context)
		poller.HandleFunc(socket, zmqutil.POLLIN, func (e *zmqutil.SocketEvent) {
			println(string(e.Message[0]))
			if (string(e.Message[0]) == "STOP") {
				e.Fault = errors.New("received 'STOP'")
				println("Stopping...")
			}
		})
		socket.Bind("tcp://localhost:5555")
		poller.Run()
	}

## Building

Build tags are used to distinguish versions of ØMQ.  Version 2.1 is `zmq_2_1`,
2.2 is `zmq_2_x`, and 3.2 is `zmq_3_x`.  If no build tags are specified then the
default is 2.2 and this is reflected in the documentation generated by godoc.
