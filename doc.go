/*
Package zmqutil implements some Ã˜MQ (http://www.zeromq.org) abstractions
and utilities.

A context from this package remembers its sockets and has its own Linger
option.  When a context is closed, it will set the Linger option on each
socket that would linger longer and then close them all.

An additonal type, Poller, provides a convenient way to attach event
handlers to sockets.
