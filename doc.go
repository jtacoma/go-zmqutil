Package zmqutil implements some Ã˜MQ (http://www.zeromq.org) abstractions and
utilities.

A context from this package remembers its sockets and has its own Linger
option.  When a context is closed, it will set the Linger option on each
socket then close them all.

All socket options are available through option-specific getter/setter methods.

A reactor loop that lets event handlers be attached to sockets.

    import (
        "errors"
        "time"

        zmq "github.com/alecthomas/gozmq"
        "github.com/jtacoma/go-zmqutil"
    )

    func main() {
        context := zmqutil.NewContext()
        defer context.Close()
        context.SetLinger(1 * time.Second)
        socket, _ := context.NewSocket(zmq.SUB)
        poller, _ := zmqutil.NewPoller(context)
        poller.HandlFunc(socket, zmq.POLLIN, func (e *zmqutil.SocketEvent) error {
            println(string(msg[0]))
            if (string(msg[0]) == "STOP") {
                e.Fault = errors.New("received 'STOP'")
                println("Stopping...")
            }
        })
        socket.Bind("tcp://localhost:5555")
